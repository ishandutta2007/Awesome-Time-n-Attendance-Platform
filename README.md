# Top Terraform Automation Platforms Ecosystem
**Curated List of SaaS Products & Open-Source GitHub Projects**
*Focused on Terraform / OpenTofu Orchestration, PR Automation, Policy-as-Code, Remote State, Drift Detection & IaC Collaboration (TACOs)*
**Last updated: August 2026**

This repository tracks notable **SaaS platforms** and **open-source projects** for **Terraform Automation** (often called TACOs – Terraform Automation and Collaboration Software). These tools orchestrate Terraform/OpenTofu runs, provide pull-request automation, policy enforcement, remote state management, drift detection, and team collaboration around infrastructure as code.

**Examples** include Terraform Cloud, Spacelift, Scalr, env0, Atlantis, Firefly, Brainboard, Massdriver, Digger, and OpsLevel (the category leaders and notable players).

**Open-source emphasis**: The open-source side is strong, led by **Atlantis** (the classic PR automation tool) and **Digger** (CI-native orchestration). This section is heavily expanded with these and related projects that let teams run Terraform automation without proprietary lock-in.

Contributions welcome! Open a PR to add/update entries. Keep descriptions factual and link to official sites.

## SaaS/Hosted Platforms
- **[Terraform Cloud / HCP Terraform](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform)**  
  HashiCorp’s official managed platform for remote state, run orchestration, private registries, and team collaboration around Terraform.

- **[Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/)**  
  Multi-IaC orchestration platform supporting Terraform, OpenTofu, Terragrunt, Pulumi, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and Ansible with strong policy-as-code and stack dependencies.

- **[Scalr](https://scalr.com/)**  
  Pure-play Terraform/OpenTofu TACO focused on governance, OPA policies, remote operations, and predictable per-run pricing.

- **[env0 (env zero)](https://www.env0.com/)**  
  Multi-IaC management platform with FinOps visibility, supporting Terraform, OpenTofu, Terragrunt, Pulumi, and more.

- **[Atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io/)**  
  (Listed here for completeness; primarily open-source — see Open-Source section.) Self-hosted Terraform pull-request automation that many teams also run as a managed service pattern.

- **[Firefly](https://www.firefly.ai/)**  
  Cloud asset management and IaC platform that helps discover, codify, and manage infrastructure with Terraform-related workflows.

- **[Brainboard](https://www.brainboard.co/)**  
  Visual infrastructure-as-code design and automation platform that generates and manages Terraform.

- **[Massdriver](https://www.massdriver.cloud/)**  
  Platform engineering and infrastructure orchestration tool with Terraform support and developer self-service.

- **[Digger](https://digger.dev/)**  
  (Primarily open-source with optional cloud features — see Open-Source section.) IaC orchestration that runs Terraform/OpenTofu inside your existing CI.

- **[OpsLevel](https://www.opslevel.com/)**  
  Service catalog and platform engineering tool that often integrates with Terraform workflows for ownership and maturity tracking.

## Open-Source GitHub Projects
- **[Atlantis](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis)**  
  The classic open-source Terraform Pull Request Automation tool. Listens for VCS webhooks, runs plan/apply, and comments results back on PRs. Apache-2.0, widely adopted and self-hosted.

- **[Digger (OpenTaco)](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger)**  
  Open-source IaC orchestration that runs Terraform/OpenTofu natively inside your existing CI pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.). No extra compute or third-party secrets required; supports drift detection, policies, and more.

- **[Terrateam](https://github.com/)**  
  Open-source self-hosted Terraform/OpenTofu PR automation with strong Terragrunt support and additional IaC engines.

- **[OpenTofu](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu)**  
  Community-driven open-source fork of Terraform that many automation platforms now support natively as a drop-in engine.

- **[Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt)**  
  Thin wrapper for Terraform/OpenTofu that provides extra tools for keeping configurations DRY, often used with Atlantis or Digger.

- **[tf-controller / Flux Terraform Controller](https://github.com/)**  
  Kubernetes-native controllers for managing Terraform resources in a GitOps style.

- **[Infracost](https://github.com/infracost/infracost)**  
  Open-source tool that shows cloud cost estimates for Terraform plans directly in pull requests.

- **[Checkov / tfsec / Terrascan](https://github.com/)**  
  Open-source static analysis and policy-as-code scanners for Terraform that integrate into CI and automation platforms.

- **[OPA / Conftest](https://github.com/open-policy-agent)**  
  Open Policy Agent and related tools widely used for policy-as-code enforcement in Terraform workflows.

- **[Terraform modules and Atlantis deployment examples](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-atlantis)**  
  Ready-to-use Terraform modules and community patterns for deploying Atlantis itself on cloud infrastructure.

### Additional Strong Open-Source Options
- Custom GitHub Actions / GitLab CI templates for plan/apply with locking and commenting.
- Drift detection scripts and scheduled pipelines.
- Private module registry implementations (e.g., using Git or Artifactory).
- State backend helpers and migration tools.
- Multi-account / multi-environment orchestration wrappers.

**Frameworks for building custom systems**: For most teams the combination of **Atlantis** or **Digger** + **OpenTofu/Terraform** + **OPA/Checkov** + your existing CI runners provides a complete, fully open-source automation stack. Run plans and applies from pull requests, enforce policies, detect drift on a schedule, and keep all secrets and state inside your own infrastructure. This approach eliminates per-run or per-resource SaaS fees while retaining full control and auditability.

## Disclaimer
- This is a **community-curated** list — not exhaustive and not an endorsement.
- Terraform automation platforms execute infrastructure changes that can affect production systems and incur cloud costs. Open-source tools give excellent transparency and cost control but still require proper secret management, state locking, policy design, and operational safeguards.
- Always test workflows thoroughly and follow least-privilege principles for cloud credentials used by automation.
